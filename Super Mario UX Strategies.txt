Super Mario UX

// Game Play shows you how to Play
  Direction he's pointing
  Bad guy with angry eyebrows come towards you
  mushroom is same shape
  reinforces jumping because you can't jump over it
  blinking
  Most of the first level

No one reads a modal
If you don't want anyone to find the body, put it in a modal

W1-2 Original Super Mario
  You drop down and break a block
  right after are some blocks with coins below
  rewards
  Intro an element in a safe environment that can't hurt you
  Then brings back the element in a slightly more difficult
  And ratches up more risk & reward

Applied to App design || education
  Intro element in safe environment
  Provide opty to use element
  Repeat the element in increasing difficulty as you go

  Intro new element w/no clutter
  More robust and increasing complexity as you go

Super Mario 3D world
  Places laser hockey puck underneath a question block - you know you want to get to the question block, so you head towards it

  Make it accessible for new users but also for power players

As example, look at Slack
  Welcome screen clean with short description with a button below AND a link to skip the tutorial
  Green button opens up what you can do (write a message) - makes you use the app

Nintendo design
  Game play first
  Character design later
  Picman -> two actions: throw and retrieve

  Toss mario hat to enemy, and you can now control the enemy
    enemy can only do two things

  Take just a few mechanics and apply them to many situations

  Think about how so many of the apps include posting text and images, but their constraints shaped the way we use them:
    Facebook started with must have had EDU email - encouraged people to connect with closer people
    Twitter - 140 character limitation at the beginning - encouraged people to follow famous people

  What is the primary focus of your app

  Legend of Zelda - Breath of the Wild
    It's about exploration
    Every mechanic is shaped to encourage exploring
    They actually designed it in a 2D world (I think that's what he said)
    Skyrim got boring once he leveled up to best material -
    Zelda had it where the sword would break early on
    Korax seeds to find help you expand inventory, but were scattered around
    Early games had locked areas to Create
    Breath of the Wild -> all was open with various items to be discovered, empty map that you had to mark up

    All mechanics encourage exploration
      Gameplay is what is the primary thing to do?
      Mechanics are the interactions that encourage core game play

  Check out Pro-Create for embodying this concept
    Tools are mostly invisible
    UI hides non-using tools
